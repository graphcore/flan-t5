# Flan-T5 on IPUs

![Flan-T5 header](flan-t5.png.webp)

Flan-T5 is the fine-tuned version of the T5 language model. Compared to T5, Flan-T5 has been fine-tuned on more than 1,000 additional tasks. This makes Flan-T5 a more efficient, open-source alternative to large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4.

Try running Flan-T5 for yourself on the IPU (Intelligence Processing Unit), a completely new kind of massively parallel processor designed to accelerate machine intelligence. Access advanced, cost-efficient IPU compute on demand in the cloud via Paperspace notebooks to build, fine-tune and deploy AI models such as Flan-T5.



## Flan-T5 notebooks powered by IPUs

| Notebook | Framework | Type | Try for Free
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Flan-T5 is (probably) all you need | Hugging Face | Inference | [![Gradient](https://assets.paperspace.io/img/gradient-badge.svg)](https://ipu.dev/4qFXZd)

In this Paperspace notebook, you will learn how to use Flan-T5 for some common NLP tasks including text generation, sentiment analysis, advanced named entity recognition, question answering, intent classification, summarization and text classification.

Note: If you have an existing Flan-T5 application based on Hugging Face, you only need to change two lines of code to be able to run it on IPUs.
